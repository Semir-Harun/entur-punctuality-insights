## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This project provides **comprehensive analytics of Norwegian public transport punctuality** using advanced data science methodologies to understand operator performance, service quality patterns, and passenger experience optimization.

### **Problem → Hypothesis → Method → Insights → Implications**

**🔍 Problem**: Norwegian public transport systems require detailed punctuality analysis to optimize service quality, assess operator performance, and improve passenger satisfaction across multiple regions and transport modes.

**💡 Hypothesis**: Public transport punctuality follows predictable patterns influenced by operator efficiency, seasonal factors, external disruptions (COVID-19), and route characteristics, with measurable improvement opportunities through data-driven optimization.

**📊 Method**: Time series analysis with operator performance ranking, seasonal decomposition, passenger impact assessment, and predictive forecasting using Python's data science ecosystem.

**🎯 Insights**: 84.6% average punctuality across operators, Bybanen leading at 92.1%, significant COVID-19 impact with full recovery by 2021, and clear seasonal patterns enabling targeted improvements.

**🌟 Implications**: Enables operator benchmarking, service optimization strategies, passenger communication improvements, and provides replicable framework for public transport analytics globally.
